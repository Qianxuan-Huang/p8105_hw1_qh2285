# Problem 1
```{r}
library("palmerpenguins")
```

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
head(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```
The penguins dataset includes 344 rows 8 columns. All 6 penguins are species Adelie from island Torgersen in year 2007. They have different bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex. The mean flipper length is 200.9152 mm.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

p = ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Flipper Length (mm)", color = "Species") 
print(p)

ggsave("problem1_scatterplot.png", plot = p)
```

# Problem 2

* Create data frameï¼š
```{r}
random_sample = rnorm(10)
logical_vector = random_sample > 0
character_vector = sample(letters, 10)
factor_levels = c("L1", "L2", "L3")
factor_vector = factor(sample(factor_levels, 10, replace = TRUE))

data_frame = data.frame(random_sample, logical_vector, character_vector, factor_vector)
print(data_frame)
```

* Take the mean of each variable in above dataframe:

1. Mean of random_sample:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

mean_random_sample =  mean(pull(data_frame, random_sample))
print(mean_random_sample)

```
Mean of random_sample works.

2. Mean of logical_vector:
```{r}

mean_logical_vector =  mean(pull(data_frame, logical_vector))
print(mean_logical_vector)

```
Mean of logical_vector works.

3. Mean of character_vector:
```{r}

mean_character_vector =  mean(pull(data_frame, character_vector))
print(mean_character_vector)

```
Mean of character_vector doesn't work.

4. Mean of factor_vector
```{r}

mean_factor_vector =  mean(pull(data_frame, factor_vector))
print(mean_factor_vector)

```
Mean of factor_vector doesn't work.


* Convert variables to numerical variables: 
```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
numeric_logical = as.numeric(data_frame$logical_vector)

numeric_character = as.numeric(data_frame$character_vector)

numeric_factor = as.numeric(data_frame$factor_vector)
```
Only numeric_character shows warning, because as.numeric() extracts the inner numbers encoding of variables and no numbers are in character_vector.
R convert "False" and "True" in logical_vector into 0 and 1, so mean of logical_vector can be calculated and can be converted to numerical variables.
Partial factor_vector include number, e.g. "L1" convert to 1. But mean of character_vector cannot be calculated when character_vector is still not numerical variable.
